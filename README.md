# sync-youtube-playlist.sh
Match videos in a directory against the contents of a YouTube-DL `--download-archive` file and list any videos that aren't in the file (and therefore, no longer in the playlist). Adds additional functionality to YouTube-DL that can be used to actually mirror/sync a YouTube playlist to the filesystem.
